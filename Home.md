To get a **STA130 Custom NBLM ChatBot** (which allows you to interact to interact with a ChatBot that wants to answer ALL your questions as if they could be answered based on the STA130 wiki-textbook, TUT, LEC, and HW materials) the MarkDown conversions of course documents stored at https://github.com/pointOfive/chat130 must be downloaded and uploaded as markdown files (all at once) into a notebook on https://notebooklm.google/.
